## Project Description

For our first General Assembly project, we are creating portfolio websites to showcase our work. I want to have a minimal and clean design, that accentuates flow and design trends. I want to create sections that will describe the disciplines I specialize in addition to showcasing my projects. I hope to additionally incorporate a technical skills section that will detail my knowledge of tech tools beyond the project requirements.

## Code Snippet

For the follow piece of code, I created a function that performed the logic of applying particular template style to each Project JSON object I was pulling in, separating the first in the list to always display in an enlarged feature format when in Desktop view and the rest to display in a flex grid underneath the main project preview. 

```
    // for desktop view: for each project in the array
    projects.forEach((project,index) => {
        //if the project in the array is the first one (Index 0) 
        // then append the project to the template I have made for the big feature Project
        if (index === 0) {
        const $bigFeatureDiv = featuredProjectDiv(project)
        $('#feature').append($bigFeatureDiv)
        }

        //if the project is in the rest of the array
        // then append the project to the grid template I have made for the rest of the features
        else {
        const $projectDiv = createProjectElement(project)
        $('#desktop').append($projectDiv)
        }
    })
```
